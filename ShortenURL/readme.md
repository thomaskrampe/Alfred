# Shorten URL
This workflow is created with TinyURL as the URL shortener. If you like you can switch to a different one.

I provide two demo scripts for:
  * [is.gd](https://is.gd) which is free
  * [t1p.de](https://www.t1p.de) which is free as well but need an API key to work. For using this script you have to install jq as JSON parser on your system. You can easy install **jq** via Homebrew https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/jq - just use `brew install jq`. This URL shortener is available in german only.

Just change the script content of the "Run Script Action" in your workflow. Or create a workflow with all URL shortener together.
