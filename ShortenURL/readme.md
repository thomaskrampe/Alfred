# Shorten URL
## TinyURL Shortener
This workflow is created with TinyURL as the primary URL shortener. If you like you can switch to a different one.

I provide two demo shell scripts for:
  * [is.gd](https://is.gd) which is a free shortener
  * [t1p.de](https://www.t1p.de) which is free as well but need an API key to work. For using this script you have to install jq as a JSON parser on your system. You can easy install **jq** via Homebrew https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/jq - just use `brew install jq`. This URL shortener is available in german only.

Just change the script content of the "Run Script Action" in your workflow. 

## URL Shortener
Or create a workflow with all URL shortener together. I provide this as a demo workflow as well.
